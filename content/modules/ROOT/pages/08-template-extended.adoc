= 1.6 - Creating a second and third Job Templates


Let's use what we learned previously and create a second and third *Job Templates*.

* Our *second Job Template* will be named *Extended services* and use the *extended_services.yml* playbook found in the *Additional playbooks* project. This playbook will deploy a PostgreSQL database in *node3* server, which belongs to the *[database]* group of our *Lab-Inventory*.

* And our *third Job Template* will be named *Set motd* and use the *motd_facts.yml* playbook also found in the *Additional playbooks* project. This playbook will set a message of the day only in *node1*.

NOTE: Notice how we can use Playbooks from the same Project in different Job Templates.
