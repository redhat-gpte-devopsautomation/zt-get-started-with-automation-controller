= 1.7 - Creating a Workflow Job Template


A https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/workflow_templates.html[Workflow Job Template, window=_blank] links together a sequence of disparate resources that accomplishes the task of tracking the full set of jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit. These resources may include:

* job templates
* workflow templates
* project syncs
* inventory source syncs

Only *Workflow Templates* have the Workflow Visualizer icon (wf-viz-icon) as a shortcut for accessing the workflow editor.

NOTE: Remember, do not confuse a *Job Template* with a *Jinja template*, or now with *Workflow Job Template*.  They are 3 separate things.
