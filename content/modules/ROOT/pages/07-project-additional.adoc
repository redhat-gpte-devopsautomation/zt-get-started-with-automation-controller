= 1.5 - Creating a second Project

We already have a *Project* called *Apache playbooks* from a previous challenge, where we can find the *apache.yml* and *test_apache_role.yml*  playbooks.

In this new challenge, we are going to create a second project named *Additional playbooks*, which will include the following playbooks: *extended_services.yml* (installs postfix and postgresql), *motd_facts.yml* (sets a message of the day) and *loop_users.yml* (creates multiple users).
