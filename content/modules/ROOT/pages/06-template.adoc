= 1.4 - Creating a Job Template

In automation controller a https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html[job template, window=_blank] is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job,  which is usually known as a playbook. *Job Templates* are useful to execute the same job many times. Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible content and collaboration between teams.

To create a *Job Template* you need to have a *Project* from which to source our *Playbooks*. We created our project in the previous challenge. Also note that although a *Project* might contain multiple *Playbooks*, a *Job Template* can only run one of those playbooks.

In automation controller when we want to run multiple playbooks we need to use a *Job Template Workflow*, which we will review in another challenge ahead.

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse a Job Template with a Jinja template. Jinja templates are used to create dynamic files, with variables and facts usually for configuration files. If you don't know Jinja, don't worry about it right now, just know that they are different things.
