= 1.1 - Creating an Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs (ex. playbooks) may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file, it indicates which nodes will be managed by the control machine, in this case the automation controller.

https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html[Inventories, window=_blank] may be divided into *groups* and these groups contain the actual *hosts*. The *hosts* may be sourced manually or dynamically and can be referenced by their *IP addresses* or their *hostnames*.

In automation controller you will be able to run multiple playbooks against these inventories without recreating them.
