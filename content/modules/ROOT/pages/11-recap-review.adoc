= Recap and review

*Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes*

Now that we have created our Inventory, Projects and Job Templates, as well as run a full Workflow, let's get back to the *Views* section and look a bit at the new graphs and data shown in each of them.

== Hands-On Experience

======
.‚òëÔ∏è Task 1 - Review the Dashboard view
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In the Automation Controller browser tab.


. Visit the *Dashboard* view and notice the difference when we first started. You should be seeing 4 hosts, 2 inventories and 3 projects. Also, you will notice a green line in the graph, showing the successful executions of our Job Templates.

. You can dive deeper by clicking on the *Recent Jobs* and *Recent Templates* tabs right above the line graph.

. Another way to look at the executed jobs is to go to the *Jobs* link in the sidebar, under the *Views* section.

. Notice they are not only *Playbook runs*, but also *Source control updates*. The *Jobs* view will show everything we *Launched* (rocket icon).
