= 1.8 - BONUS: Creating a Job Template with a Survey

*Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes*

BONUS TRACK!

This is an **optional bonus track**. If you want to try the *Survey* feature of *Automation controller* go ahead and review the tasks in this track, otherwise, you can skip and move to the final chapter: *Recap & review*.

In this challenge, we will explore the Survey feature, which allows us to input a variable at runtime when we execute our Job Template (playbook), making it possible to change a parameter or setting at each run.

We will be changing the index.html we deployed previously for a new one.
