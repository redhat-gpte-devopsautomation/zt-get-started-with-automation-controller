IMPORTANT: All the fields are *case-sensitive* and the check will fail! Please maske sure you use the same capitalization as used in the assignments.

Besides the automation controller instance, your environment also contains two virtual machines:

* *host01*
* *host02*

// We've also added extra terminal tabs to these machines, so you can have a look around.

These machines are configured to be able to *ssh* to each other using an ssh key.
