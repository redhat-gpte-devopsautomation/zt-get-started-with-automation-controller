=  1.3 - Get to know Credentials


https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html[Credentials, window=_blank] are utilized by automation controller for authentication when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

Credentials are imported and stored encrypted within automation controller, and are not retrievable in plain text on the command line by any user.  You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential to the user itself.

There are multiple types of credential types, ranging from tokens, to user/passwords or public keys. In total, there are over 20 supported types and even the option to create *Custom* ones. We will explore the *Machine* credential type today, which we will use to connect to the servers in our inventory through SSH.

IMPORTANT: In this excercise we are not making any changes. Credentials are pre-loaded.
